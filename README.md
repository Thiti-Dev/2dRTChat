### Envelop

Ability to leave messages or "envelopes" in the virtual world. If I am available, I will check these messages out and interact with them, creating a dynamic and interactive communication experience within the virtual space.

## Purpose

ðŸŽ¯ The purpose of this project is to provide a unique and immersive platform for social interaction in a virtual space. As someone who isn't often active on social media and finds it challenging for people around me to reach out, I wanted to create a space where friends and acquaintances could connect with me in a more engaging and personal way. Through this virtual world, I aim to foster meaningful connections and create memorable experiences for everyone involved.
